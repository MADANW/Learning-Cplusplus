These notes will be different from the ones in basicSyntax since I will start writing about the usage of different data structures and algorithms in C++.

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.
